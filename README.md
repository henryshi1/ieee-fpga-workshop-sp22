# Instructions

Install Vivado software.

Open the project by double-clicking the `vivado_test.xpr` file in the `vivado_test` folder.

The assembly code file is `half_adder.sv`, which you should see in the Vivado window that opens up for `vivado_test.xpr`. It is located in `./vivado_test/vivado_test.srcs/sources_1/new` if you want to access the file outside of the application.
